This works fairly well in most cases, but unfortunately English has many exceptions where a more sophisticated process is required. In fact, spaCy doesn't include a stemmer, opting instead to rely entirely on lemmatization. For those interested, there's some background on this decision [here](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/327).
