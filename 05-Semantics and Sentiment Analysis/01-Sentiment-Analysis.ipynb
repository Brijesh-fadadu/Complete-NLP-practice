Polarity classification\n","We won't try to determine if a sentence is objective or subjective, fact or opinion. Rather, we care only if the text expresses a *positive*, *negative* or *neutral* opinion.\n","### 2. Document level scope\n","We'll also try to aggregate all of the sentences in a document or paragraph, to arrive at an overall opinion.\n","### 3. Coarse analysis\n","We won't try to perform a fine-grained analysis that would determine the degree of positivity/negativity. That is, we're not trying to guess how many stars a reviewer awarded, just whether the review was positive or negative."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bXaOz_aSsjAy"},"source":["## Broad Steps:\n","* First, consider the text being analyzed.
